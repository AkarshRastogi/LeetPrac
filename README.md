# LeetPrac
LeetPrac is a Chrome extension that lets you set reminders to revisit LeetCode problems at a chosen date and time. The popup displays the current date and time before setting the reminder. Reminders are stored and trigger notifications when due, helping you stay on track with your LeetCode practice.
